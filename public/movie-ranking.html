<h2>Movies I really enjoyed</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>Captivating and full of pretty views, it also contains one of my favorite LOTR battles.</p>
<h3>Thor Ragnarok</h3>
<p>A wild ride from beginning to end, with great directing by Taika Waititi.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Amazing special effects and sound effects for its time, and an all-round fun movie.</p>
